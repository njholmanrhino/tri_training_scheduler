    "This notebook aims to deliver training session plans to various triathletes that I coach which takes into account their aims and goals in triathlon, their current fitness and their time and availability. The outcome of this is to create a training programme that gives an achievable stretch to their training and aiming to increase their training load (which manifests in the form of training volume and training intensity) safely."
